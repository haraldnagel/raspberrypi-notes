Raspberry Pi Notes
===
This repository holds my notes and information about working with the [Raspberry Pi single-board computer](http://www.raspberrypi.org).

* My current configuration for a new Pi is headless running Raspbian Jessie Lite and I have my [initial configuration](notes/InitialConfiguration.md) notes for that setup.

* Prior to Jessie Lite, I used Raspbian Wheezy and similar [initial headless configuration](notes/InitialConfigurationWheezy.md) including a large number of [packages which could be removed](notes/HeadlessConfigWheezy.md) on a headless system.

* I added some [package notes](notes/PackageNotes.md) for things I noticed installing packages.

* I have a system at home (still running Wheezy) configured as a [PSK VPN server](notes/VPNServer.md).

* Using a GPS board and a prototype board from Adafruit I have several Stratum 1 NTP servers configured [following these steps](notes/NTPServer.md).

* Out of curiosity I obtained a Hummingboard and did some [performance testing](HummingBoardvsRPi2.md) with it.
